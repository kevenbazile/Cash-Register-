No ai used for this site i just figured out where all files were through the page source so i could esstentially automate that task with a rpa or a system that allows for a software or bot to 
parse through site, look for page source, copy index.html, click the styles.css and copy and repeat the same steps for the script.js being those task are tedious and repetitive. so in essense you can automate the process of a website but has to make sense to you and your business
